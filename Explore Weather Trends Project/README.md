# Exploring Weather Trends
In this project, I analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live "Mecca" to overall global temperature trends and create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Mecca. To do this, there are 4 steps:

### 1- Extract data from a database using a SQL query
Udacity provide a workspace to extract data from the temperatures database. There are three tables in the database:
- city_list - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database. Look through them in order to find the city nearest to you.
- city_data - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
- global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).
