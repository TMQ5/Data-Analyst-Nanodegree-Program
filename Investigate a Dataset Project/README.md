# Investigate a Dataset
## Project Overview
In this project, we will analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make our analysis easier.

## Project Instructions
These steps need to follow:
#### Step One - Choose Our Data Set
Click [this link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/5b57919a_data-set-options/data-set-options.pdf) (available in a Google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTlVmknRRnfy_4eTrjw5hYGaiQim5ctr9naaRd4V9du2B5bxpd8FEH3KtDgp8qVekw7Cj1GLk1IXdZi/pub?embedded=True)) to open a document with links and information about data sets that we can investigate for this project. We must choose one of these datasets to complete the project.

#### Step Two - Get Organized
Eventually weâ€™ll want to submit our project (and share it with friends, family, and employers). Get organized before we begin. It's recommend to create a single folder that will eventually contain:

- The **report** communicating our findings
- Any **Python code** we wrote as part of our analysis
- The **data set** we used (which we will not need to submit)

(We use a Jupyter notebook, in which case we can submit both the code we wrote and the report of our findings in the same document).

#### Step Three - Analyze Your Data
Brainstorm some questions we could answer using the data set we chose, then start answering those questions. We can find some questions in the [data set options](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/5b57919a_data-set-options/data-set-options.pdf) to help us get started.

Suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. We should aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in our investigation. Also we make sure we use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

#### Step Four - Share Your Findings
Once we have finished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the findings we found most interesting. If we use a Jupyter notebook, share our findings alongside the code we used to perform the analysis. Make sure that our report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish our comments and findings from our code work. We also free to use other tools and software to craft our final report, but make sure that we can submit our report as an HTML or PDF file so that it can be opened easily.

#### Step Five - Review
Use the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/3025/view) to review our project.



## Tools Used in the project
We'll use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib

## Project Submission
#### What to include in our submission
1. A PDF or HTML file containing our analysis. This file should include:
- A note specifying which dataset we analyzed
- A statement of the question(s) we posed
- A description of what we did to investigate those questions
- Documentation of any data wrangling we did
- Summary statistics and plots communicating our final results
2. Code we used to perform our analysis. If we used a Jupyter notebook, we can submit our `.ipynb`. Otherwise, we should submit the code separately in `.py` file(s).
3. A list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories, etc. that we referred to or used in creating our submission (add N/A if we did not use any such resources).
