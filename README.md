# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Program
## Overview
I've been awarded a scholarship from [One Million Arab Coders Initiative](https://arabcoders.ae/) to study this nanodegree provided by Udacity.

This course helps to advance your programming skills and refine your ability to work with messy, complex datasets. You’ll learn to manipulate and prepare data for analysis, and create visualizations for data exploration. Finally, you’ll learn to use your data skills to tell a story with data.
