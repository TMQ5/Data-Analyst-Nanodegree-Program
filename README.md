# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Program
## Overview
I've been awarded a scholarship from [One Million Arab Coders Initiative](https://arabcoders.ae/) to study this Nanodegree provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

This course helps to advance your programming skills and refine your ability to work with messy, complex datasets. You’ll learn to manipulate and prepare data for analysis, and create visualizations for data exploration. Finally, you’ll learn to use your data skills to tell a story with data.

### This Nanodegree has 5 parts with 5 real world project:
##### Introduction to Data Analysis**
Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
###### Explore Weather Trends Project
In this project, you'll get familiar with SQL, and learn how to download data from a database. You’ll analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

###### Investigate a Dataset
You will choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

* **Practical Statistics**
Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

* **Data Wrangling**
Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.


* **Data Visualization with Python**
Learn to apply visualization principles to the data analysis process. Explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.
