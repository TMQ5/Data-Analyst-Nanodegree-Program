    "## Step1: Gathering Data\n",
    "I gathered data from 3 different soureces and different file formats:  \n",
    "**1) WeRateDogs Twitter archive (twitter_archive_enhanced.csv):**   \n",
    "This file is in CSV format and I doanloaded it manually by clicking the link provided in Udacity and save at in my computer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) tweet image predictions(image_predictions.tsv):**  \n",
    "This file is TSV file and I doanloaded it programmatically using the Requests library and [this URL](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv).     \n",
    "\n",

    "## Step2: Assessing Data\n",
    "After gathering data and read it into a dataframe, I assessed them and looked for issues. These issues are what I found it in every dataframe:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality: \n",
    "#### `df_twitter_archive`  \n",
    "- **Missing values (NaN)**: in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp, expanded_urls   \n",
    "- **Erroneous datatype**: timestamp, tweet_id \n",
    "- **Incorrect dog name** like: a , an , just, the, not (The wrong words are written in lowercase) and None means the tweets not dogs. \n",
    "- **Invalid values** for numerator and denominator, and there are 4 dogs have two stages (doggo pupper) and that is invalid it must be one stage for every single dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `df_image_predications` \n",
    "- **Erroneous datatype**: tweet_id\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `df_tweets`\n",
    "- **Erroneous datatype**: id \n",
    "- **Missing values (NaN)** in 16 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness: \n",
    "\n",
    "- 3 separate DataFrames that need to be merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "- column name in **df_tweets** dataframe need to be changed to be as the other two dataframes to merge them later: (id).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dog stage in **df_twitter_archive** DataFrame is in 4 different columns need to be in one.\n",

    "\n",
    "### After mereged the 3 dataframes , These issues appeard:\n",
    "### Quality: \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are missing values (NaN) \n",
    "- Erroneous datatype for retweet_count and favorite_count columns\n",
    "- We only want original ratings without retweets\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Unneeded columns.\n",

    "# Step3: Cleaning Data\n",
    "For missing values and invalid data I dropped them and for incorrect datatypes I change them into the appropriate datatypes using `.astypes`. Also I merged the 3 dataframes into one dataframe using `.merge` and fixed the iissues that appeared like changing the datatypes and dropping unneeded columns, missing values, and text that is 'retweet' not a dog rating. Finally, I stored the clean dataframe as CSV file named `twitter_archive_master.csv`"
