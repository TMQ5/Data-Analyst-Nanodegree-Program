# Analyze A/B Test Results
## Project Overview
For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
The project contains 3 main important statistical parts:
1. Probabilities part
2. A/B Test part
3. Regression part

## Tools Used in the project
We'll use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib

## Project Submission
Once we are satisfied with the status of our Notebook, we should save it in a format that will make it easy for others to read. We can use the **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)** menu to save our notebook as an .html file. If we get an error about "No module name", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using `pip install <module_name>` (don't include the "<" or ">" or any words following a period in the module name).

We will submit both our original Notebook and an HTML or PDF copy of the Notebook for review. There is no need for us to include any data files with our submission. If we made reference to other websites, books, and other resources to help us in solving tasks in the project, we make sure that document them. It is recommended that we either add a "Resources" section in a Markdown cell at the end of the Notebook report, or can include a `readme.txt` file documenting our sources.
